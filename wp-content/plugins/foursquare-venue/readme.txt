Foursquare Venue is a simple but powerful plugin for displaying any venue's Foursquare stats.

== Description ==

Foursquare Venue gives you the ability to display any venue's latest stats on your WordPress site. Using either the widget or shortcode, you will be able to display:

*   People here now
*   Total check-ins
*   Current mayor (along with their picture and number of check-ins)

I'm open to any feedback and suggestions.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `/foursquare-venue/` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Once activated, there are two ways to display venue stats:

* On the 'Widgets' page listed under 'Appearance,' drag the Foursquare Venue widget to your desired widget area and set the venue ID.
* On any post or page, add the shortcode `[venue id=3945]`, replacing the '3945' with the venue's ID.

The venue's ID can be found as a number at the end of the venue's URL on Foursquare.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The stats are wrong or I'm getting an error, what did I do wrong? =

The most likely problem is that you haven't set a proper venue ID. This is the number from the end of the venue's URL (ex: `3945`).
